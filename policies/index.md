# Privacy Policy

Schola Cantorum is committed to respecting the privacy of its patrons and other
web site visitors.  This web site collects and uses your personally identifiable
information in only the following ways:

* If you use our "Email List" form to join our email list, we will provide your
  email address to MailChimp, which manages our email list with the highest
  industry standard for privacy.  MailChimp has its own detailed
  [privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

* If you use our "U.S. Mail List" form to join our U.S. mail list, we will
  retain your address on our mailing list.

* If you make a donation or order a product through this web site, we will
  collect your name, mailing address, and email address.  We will use these to
  acknowledge your donation and/or fulfill your order.  We may also add you to
  our U.S. mail and email mailing lists.

We use our U.S. mail and email mailing lists to send periodic announcements of
our events, and on rare occasion, the events of other arts organizations that we
feel would be of interest to our patrons.  We never share our mailing lists with
anyone.  We will remove you from either list on request; for the email list,
there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email.
