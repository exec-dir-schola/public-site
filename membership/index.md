## Auditions

Schola Cantorum welcomes new members to carry on its tradition of bringing the
finest classical and sacred music to the South Bay Area since 1964. We invite
adult singers of all vocal ranges, and musical and cultural backgrounds to
audition. Singers should be able to sight-read and learn their parts on their
own. Some college choral experience is preferred.

View our [audition brochure](/membership/audition.pdf) for full details and information.

Auditions are generally held by appointment with Schola Cantorum’s Music
Director, Gregory Wait. To schedule an audition, please call the Schola Cantorum
office at (650) 254–1700.

Each audition lasts approximately 15 minutes, and consists of:

* Vocalization to determine your vocal range and voice quality
* A brief sight-reading exercise
* A short [solo](/membership/audition-solo.pdf) to sing for the music director.  (You may
  prepare this solo in any key.)

The music director will evaluate your potential as a member, in the following
areas:

* A good choral voice, not necessarily of solo quality
* A sensitivity to the music and its interpretation
* The ability to learn your part by yourself
* A shared vision of Schola Cantorum’s objectives for singing choral music
* The ability to blend with other voices while carrying your own part

Auditions take place at the Braun Music Center on the Stanford University campus
