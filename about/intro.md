**Schola Cantorum is a unique choral arts organization with multiple community
programs.** Its auditioned 75-voice chorus, under the baton of Gregory Wait,
presents dynamic performances of choral masterpieces, new works by major
composers and music from a wide variety of cultural traditions during the
regular concert season. Each summer, Schola Cantorum turns the audience into a
choir with its series of audience-participation _Summer Sings_. In December,
singers of all ages join together for Schola’s annual _Messiah Sing_. Schola
Cantorum’s Outreach Program takes small groups of Schola singers into schools,
senior centers, parks and public places with enriching educational programs and
participative sing-alongs.
