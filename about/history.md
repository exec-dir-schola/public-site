**Historical Highlights** Founded in 1964 by the late Royal Stanton, the chorus
has commissioned and performed numerous premieres, including works by Alva
Henderson, Dirk Damonte, Joseph Jennings, Libby Larsen, Kirke Mechem and
Theodore Toews.  Collaborations with more than 30 musical organizations have
included the Vince Guaraldi Trio, Wesla Whitfield and Michael Greensill,
Chanticleer, The Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers, Coro Hispano de San Francisco,
Rejoice Gospel Ensemble, The Nuclear Whales Saxophone Orchestra, The Whole
Noyse, Menlo Brass Quintet, the San Francisco Symphony, Master Sinfonia Chamber
Orchestra and Redwood Symphony — a testament to the group’s versatility and
professionalism.

Schola Cantorum in collaboration with the Stanford University Office for
Religious Life has organized musical tributes involving choral singers from
across the Bay Area who together performed the Mozart Requiem under Gregory
Wait’s direction to standing room only audiences on the one year and ten year
anniversaries of the 9/11 tragedy. Schola Cantorum is proud to offer many great
ways to provide thousands of community members each year the opportunity to
actively participate in the joy of singing.
