Join us this summer for our annual sing-alongs of beloved choral masterworks.
You bring the voice; we supply the scores; our accompanist Dawn Reyen provides
the 10-fingered orchestra; and a variety of local conductors stitch it all
together.  Monday nights from July 13 through August 17 in Los Altos.  Stay
tuned for full details and ticket sales.
