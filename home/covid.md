It was with great sadness that we had to cancel Elijah, only our fourth concert
under the leadership of Buddy James, who was off to a wonderful and dynamic
start. As we cannot guarantee the safety of our patrons or of Schola itself, if
we meet physically over the next few months, we have also had to make the
difficult choice to call off our Summer Sings. Finally, although we had already
moved our annual gala to August, again we feel that for the safety of all, we
will not be able to gather for that wonderful event either.
