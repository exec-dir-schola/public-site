Our top priority is assuring that everyone at a Schola event is safe.
We have taken precautions to make sure that Schola members are healthy
and will not infect others. These include requiring proof of full vaccinations
from all of our members, requiring all members to show a negative test
result done within 72 hours of each performance, and wearing masks while
performing indoors. We will at all times abide by all Federal, State, and local
requirements and guidelines. We ask that you, our loyal supporters, to join us
by showing proof of full vaccination and wearing masks while attending our live
performances. Let's share our love of music, but do it safely.
