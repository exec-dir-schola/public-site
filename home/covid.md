Along with everyone else, we are disappointed that we can't present live music
to live audiences at the moment. We will resume our tradition of presenting
outstanding live choral music as soon as we can do so safely, but in the
meantime we must protect the health of our members and our audience. However,
when one door closes, another one opens: our audience has expanded from the
Bay Area to the world!
