In the Fall of 2019 we began an exciting new era in Bay Area choral performance! Dr. Buddy James, our new Artistic Director and a long-time fan of Schola, brought fresh and exciting ideas to our 2019â€“2020 season, and he's continuing this tradition as we meet the challenges presented by the pandemic. Schola will offer its second virtual concert in **December 2020**, to a world-wide audience.

Normally, Schola sells tickets and subscriptions for its live performances to defray a portion of our expenses. Our goal this season is to provide the wonders of choral music through online **free** offerings. We just want the music to continue! Of course, we welcome your support. If you would like to make a donation to Schola, simply click the **Donate** button at the top of the page. Schola is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
