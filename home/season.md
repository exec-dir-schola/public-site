Schola Cantorum met the challenges of the pandemic by offering three virtual
concerts:

[Virtually Elijah](https://youtu.be/mbdE2IhkWwY), June 2020  
[Schola Around the World](https://youtu.be/6NW1lALW6as), December 2020  
[Homeward Bound](https://youtu.be/ejW-N9_cD0U), May 2021

Normally, Schola sells tickets and subscriptions for its live performances to defray a portion of our expenses. Our goal during the pandemic is to provide the wonders of choral music through online **free** offerings. We just want the music to continue! Of course, we welcome your support. If you would like to make a donation to Schola, simply click the **Donate** button at the top of the page.
