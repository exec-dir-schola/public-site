{{% imgfloatleft "buddy.png" "Buddy James" 150 %}} In the Fall of 2019 we began an exciting new era in Bay Area choral performance! Our new Artistic Director Buddy James, a longtime fan of Schola, brought fresh and exciting ideas to our 2019–2020 season.

Our audiences were thrilled with our first concert of the season,
when we introduced them to Duke Ellington’s rarely-performed
_[Sacred Concert](/concerts/schola-swings)_, an infusion of jazz and sacred themes that included the big band, The Daddios, jazz vocalist Juanita Harris, and even tap dancing!

Our [holiday season concert](/concerts/the-joys-of-christmas) was a fresh look at the magic of the  holidays, with a performance of Kirke Mechem’s _Seven Joys of Christmas_, harp music, and of course, our delightful audience holiday carol sing-along! We were delighted to have Kirke Mechem in the audience as well as composer Brian Holmes whose work was also presented.

Our third concert, titled [Into the West](/concerts/into-the-west), included music from, and inspired by, the Great American West Coast. We performed Eric Whitacre’s charming _Goodnight Moon_, and _Come to the Woods_ by Jake Runestad, based on the writings of John Muir. Also featured was the world premiere of a work by Eric Tuan, setting the poem _Gilded Land_, written by Sophia Smith, the winner of this year’s Poetry-to-Music Contest. This concert also saw our first use of multimedia in the form of slides projected during two of the works.

Our final concert of Season 56, a performance of _[Elijah](/concerts/elijah)_ by Felix Mendelssohn has been canceled due to the Coronavirus outbreak.
