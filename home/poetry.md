Schola Cantorum gratefully acknowledges the many talented local high school students who submitted poems to our 2019-2020 Poetry Contest.  The entry period for this seasonâ€™s poem submissions ended on September 27th. The submitted poems will now be forwarded to our judges and the ten finalists will be notified by email in January.  The winning poem will be set to music and will be performed during our first 2020 concert set, [Into the West](https://scholacantorum.org/concerts/into-the-west/), featuring music from and about the West Coast.
