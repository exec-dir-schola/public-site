**Released on Sunday, December 27, 2020**

People around the world celebrate this joyous time of year with their own
holiday music. Schola Cantorum’s Artistic Director, Buddy James, contacted
choirs from every continent and invited them to share their rich and celebratory
musical traditions with all of us!

Partnering with over 200 singers from every continent to create this special
holiday concert, Schola Cantorum was joined by our choral friends from
around the world:

아산시립합창단 Asan Civic Choir (South Korea)  
Blackstone-Ipswich Cambrian Choirs (Australia)  
Coral Cantares Dois Irmãos (Brazil)  
Coro Normalista de Puebla y su Orquesta Sinfónica (Mexico)  
Pro Musica (Lithuania)  
Schola Cantorum Akto (Democratic Republic of Congo)

Recorded in _Australia_, _Brazil_, the _Democratic Republic of Congo_,
_Lithuania_, _Mexico_, _South Korea_, and by Schola Cantorum in the _United
States_, this performance uses modern recording technology to pull all of the
voices together, resulting in a rich, authentic choral sound.

**Schola Around the World** will remain available for viewing on our YouTube channel,
[YouTube.com/ScholaCantorum1](https://youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1) along with content from **Virtually Elijah**.

**_Stay tuned for our next offering, Homeward Bound, a collection of American folk songs._**
