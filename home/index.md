With this season’s stellar repertoire, we’re celebrating Gregory Wait’s
thirtieth and final year at our podium.  We’re looking forward to lauding him
throughout the year, as well as welcoming our incoming Music Director, to be
announced in the Spring.

In our first concert of the season, we can rediscover three of **Bach**’s
cantatas from his highly productive years in Leipzig.

The holiday season concert is more special than ever, featuring one of Schola’s
favorite composers, **John Rutter**, and his wonderful Christmas impressions —
plus of course, our sparkling traditional audience carol sing-along!

For our third concert, we sing the powerful **_Carmina Burana_** by Carl Orff,
showcasing vocal soloists, _Crystal Children’s Choir_, two pianos and six
percussionists.

Our final concert of the season will bring both joy and tears, as we perform the
magnificent **Brahms’s _Ein deutsches Requiem_** with _Sinfonia Schola Cantorum_.
This event provides one last opportunity to enjoy Schola Cantorum under the
baton of the incomparable Gregory Wait, as he shares Brahms’s quintessential
masterpiece in this farewell concert.
