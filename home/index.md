We regret to report that our 2021 Summer Sing series has been **canceled**, and
tickets already purchased for it have been refunded. Recent news from the
Centers for Disease Control indicates that the Delta variant of COVID-19 is
significantly more transmissible than the common cold, even among vaccinated
people, and even in outdoor settings. We know of no way that we can hold our
Summer Sing series safely.

Please join our [mailing list](/mailing-list/) and we will let you know as soon
as we are able to schedule more musical events, either in person or virtual.
