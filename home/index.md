Welcome to an exciting new era in Bay Area choral performance! We invite you to
meet our new Artistic Director, Buddy James, a longtime fan of Schola with fresh
and exciting ideas for our 2019–2020 season.

Jazz and Big Band lovers won’t want to miss our first concert of the season,
when we introduce you to Duke Ellington’s rarely-performed
_[Sacred Concert](/concerts/schola-swings)_. It’s infused with jazz, sacred themes
and even includes a tap dancer!

The [holiday season concert](/concerts/the-joys-of-christmas) is a fresh look at
this magical holiday, with a performance of Kirke Mechem’s _Seven Joys of
Christmas_, harp music and, of course, our delightful audience holiday carol
sing-along!

Our third concert, titled [Into the West](/concerts/into-the-west), includes
music from, and inspired by, the Great American West Coast. We’ll perform
Whitacre’s charming _Goodnight Moon_, and _Come to the Woods_ by Jake Runestad,
based on the writings of John Muir. Also featured is the world premiere of a
work by Eric Tuan, using text by this year’s winner of Schola Cantorum’s
[Poetry Contest](/poetry), and much more.

Our final concert of Season 56 features thrilling performance of
_[Elijah](/concerts/elijah)_, by Felix Mendelssohn. This massive piece, sung in
English, features double chorus, four soloists and Sinfonia Schola Cantorum.
You’ll be inspired to hear Schola’s confidence and power as the great oratorio
choir audiences have come to love.
