After 608 days (but who&rsquo;s counting?) of not being able to perform live music for a live audience, Schola Cantorum presented
**_It&rsquo;s a Grand Time for Singing_** on **Saturday, October 30** at the **First Congregational Church of
Palo Alto**. It was a tremendous, uplifting experience for singers and audience alike, and we are _so_ happy to be singing again! Special
thanks go out to **John Murden** for sponsoring this concert.

Join us for our next concert, **_A Festival of Carols_**, which we&rsquo;ll present in Cupertino on **Sunday, December 12** at 2PM at
**St. Joseph of Cupertino Catholic Church**. For details, <a href="https://scholacantorum.org/concerts/festival-of-carols/">click here</a>.
