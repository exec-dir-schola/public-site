Join us as we travel, virtually, to the other continents to explore how they celebrate the holiday season.
We'll be joining in song, forming virtual choirs with each of them, as we share their music and culture.
Then we'll join together in one global performance of a treasured Christmas carol. Once again, as with
our [***Virtually Elijah***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbdE2IhkWwY) from last season, 
we'll be offering this concert **for free** to a world-wide audience.

The idea for ***Schola Around the World*** came about when we received a Facebook comment from 
[Schola Cantorum Akto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJctZfr9jM) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
We exchanged messages about our mutual situations regarding the pandemic. After some
discussion about our course through these uncharted waters, the idea of a world-wide
collaborative concert came up. Subsequently, we found three other partners:
[Coro Normalista de Puebla](https://www.facebook.com/coronormalistadepuebla) from Mexico,
[Vilnius Pro Musica](https://youtu.be/asMm3uTs5WM) from Lithuania, and the
[Ansan City Choir](https://www.wscm11.cat/ansan-city-choir-eng) from South Korea. The concert
will therefore span at least five countries on four continents!
