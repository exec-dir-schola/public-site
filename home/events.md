Our annual fundraising gala!  On April 26, we’re celebrating
[¡Fiesta! An Evening in Old California](./events/fiesta) with the colors and
sounds of the New World’s Spanish heritage and culture.  At this event, we’ll
celebrate the 30th and final year with **Maestro Gregory Wait**, and welcome his
successor, **Dr. Buddy James**.  This event is <span style="color:red">sold out</span>.
