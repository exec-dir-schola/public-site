We love to have you join us in song!  Be a part of our 52nd annual re-creation
of Handel’s _Messiah_, at the Bay Area’s oldest Messiah Sing — sing the choruses
_and_ solos!

For lighter fare, join our assistant conductor Dawn Reyen as she leads fun,
informal sing-alongs of favorite music from Oscar and Emmy winners (November)
and music for Valentine’s Day (February).
