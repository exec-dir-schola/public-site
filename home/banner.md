The staff and board of directors of Schola Cantorum are following the
developments of the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic, and the recommendations of
public health authorities.

We are continuing to rehearse under modified conditions with care for not only
our members and patrons, but for our community. As we cannot predict the
conditions that will exist in May, we continue under the premise that our
performance of Elijah will take place on May 17th as planned. We will continue
to update this information as the situation develops.

Should we have to postpone the performance, we will honor any tickets, including
FlexPasses at the rescheduled performance, or at any performance next season.

We are grateful for your understanding.

Dan Morris, Executive Director
