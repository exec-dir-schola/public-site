Dear friends of Schola Cantorum, 

As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting everything now, and it appears it will do so for some time. This has forced Schola to postpone its May 17th concert of Mendelssohn’s _Elijah_, as well as our annual Gala. Given the importance of keeping our members and our audience safe, this is the only responsible response.

If a concert is possible on May 17th, we hope to present one. Unfortunately, it will not be _Elijah_, which we still hope to present in the not-too-distant future. If a concert is not possible on May 17th, we will be back as soon as circumstances permit. Schola has celebrated the joy of singing for over half a century, and will continue to do so.

We have postponed our New Orleans Jazz Gala until August 14th, at which time we once again plan to “Let the good times roll!”  We’re all hoping this can be the celebration of life and happiness that New Orleans is known for.

We still plan to have Summer Sings starting July 13th and going through August 17th. We look forward to once again sharing the joy of singing with our members and friends.

In the meantime, please check this web site and our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/scholacantorum.org), to keep up with what we’re doing and planning to do.

We wish you all well and hope that you are staying safe and healthy, and enduring this trying period without too much difficulty.

Best regards, 
Dan Morris 
Executive Director
