As you know, the pandemic is affecting everything now, and it looks to do so for some time. Please know that Schola will be back. If a concert is possible on May 17th, we plan to present one, but unfortunately it will not be Elijah, which we still hope to present in the not too distant future. If a concert is not possible on May 17th, we will be back as soon as is possible. 

We still plan to still have Summer Sings starting July 13 and going through August 17. We look forward to once again sharing the joy of singing with our members and friends. In the meantime we wish you all well and hope that you are enduring this with not too much difficulty. 

Dan Morris, Executive Director
