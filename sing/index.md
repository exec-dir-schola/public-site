# Sing with Schola Cantorum!

Schola Cantorum is always looking for new members to celebrate the joy of
singing with us. Because we are performing and rehearsing online this season,
we can offer membership to singers who could not attend rehearsals in person.
Do you live in Montana? No problem! Do you have to stay home on Monday nights
to take care of your pet hamster? You can still join us! We meet on Monday
nights from 7:30 to 8:30 pm Pacific time. Just join us 
[via Zoom](https://csueb.zoom.us/j/96357687291?pwd=Qi84VzZPOXIxTU5IcXpkK1Y1cFlWdz09),
using the Meeting ID **963 5768 7291** and the passcode **Schola**. You can even
join using your phone, by using one of [these numbers]( https://csueb.zoom.us/u/acvza4Tau9).

If you're interested but would like to see what the experience will be like,
please join us for our next rehearsal on **Monday, September 21**, at **7:15 pm PDT**,
then arrange for a Zoom audition with Buddy. He’ll listen to you sing some of the
music we read, and have you read some other music, and then let you know whether
Schola is a good fit for you. We look forward to welcoming you!
