## How to Join

Schola Cantorum welcomes adult, musically skilled singers from all backgrounds
and all walks of life.  We take new members twice a year.  This season, new
member signups are at our rehearsals on September 16, 2019, and January 6, 2020.
Come join us as we sight read our new music on one of those nights, and then
sign up for an appointment with our director.  He’ll listen to you sing some of
the music we read, and have you read some other music, and then let you know
whether Schola is a good fit for you.  We look forward to welcoming you!

If you have any questions about joining Schola Cantorum, please call or write
our office (650-254-1700 or info@scholacantorum.org), or drop by any rehearsal
and chat with us.
