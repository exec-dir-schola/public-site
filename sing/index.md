# Sing with Schola Cantorum!

Schola Cantorum welcomes the many people who have joined us for the first
concert of the 2020–2021 season. We invite prospective new members to join us
in January 2021 for the start of our Spring season. How will we do this?
As you might expect, that depends largely on when we can resume in-person
rehearsals. Check back on this site for new developments. But in any case,
we welcome all qualified singers, and we look forward to welcoming you!
