# Volunteer with Schola

Schola Cantorum’s wonderful and dedicated volunteers provide essential support
for our concerts, programs and events. Here are some of the volunteer
opportunities available.

**Serve on a committee.**  We are especially looking for people with experience
in marketing, public relations, human resources and personnel, finance and
accounting, special event management, corporate relations and fundraising.

**Join the Board of Directors.**  Schola Cantorum’s board provides governance,
support and fund-raising for the organization. We are looking for people with
strong corporate and community connections, business, financial and personnel
management skills, and prior board experience especially in the area of
fundraising and development. We are also looking for Board members with connections
to minority communities in the Bay Area.

If you are interested in volunteering, please call the Schola Cantorum office at
(650) 254–1700, or email us at info@scholacantorum.org.
