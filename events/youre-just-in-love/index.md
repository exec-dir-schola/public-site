Treat yourself and a friend or loved one to songs about — what else? — **love**,
to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Sing the most romantic melodies of all time,
including the lively _That’s Amore_, and Broadway show Camelot’s _If Ever I
Would Leave You_.

This is an informal sing-along led by Schola Cantorum’s Assistant Conductor,
Dawn Reyen, with song lyrics projected on a screen.
