Save the date for Schola Cantorum&rsquo;s _live_, _in-person_ and _outdoor_ **_Messiah_ Sing.**
We look forward to welcoming you to the outdoor area in front of **Sacred Heart Church in Saratoga** at **3:30 pm**
on **Monday, December 19**. We know you&rsquo;ve been waiting patiently to sing this beloved masterwork,
so come join us!

We will sing the Christmas section of _Messiah_, plus other favorite movements from the work&mdash;who doesn&rsquo;t want to sing the Hallelujah Chorus?&mdash;accompanied by Schola&rsquo;s amazing Dawn Reyen on electronic piano. You can bring your own scores or borrow one from us. As always, feel free to sing the solos as well as the chorus parts.

This event is **_free_**, although we do ask that you register for it in advance so we can get an idea of how many people we will have on each voice part. Of course, if you&rsquo;d like to make a donation (we suggest $10), we would welcome it. You&rsquo; have the chance to do this on the registration page.

*Although we will be outdoors, we ask that all attendees be vaccinated, wear singing masks (ones that stay put while you open your mouth wide enough to make your glorious sounds), and maintain social distance.*
