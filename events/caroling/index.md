Members of Schola Cantorum are singing carols this year at the History House in
Los Altos for their annual “Catch the Spirit” event on November 20th as well as
Gamble Gardens on December 14th for their Community Days event in Palo Alto.
Schola singers provide outreach programs to schools and senior centers
throughout the year. Contact Dan Morris at (650) 254&#x2011;1700 or
[info@scholacantorum.org](mailto:info@scholacantorum.org) if you are interested
in scheduling an outreach performance.
