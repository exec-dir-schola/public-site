All over the globe, folks celebrate this joyous time of year with their own
holiday music. We often wonder, _what do THEY sing for Christmas?_ Schola
Cantorum’s Artistic Director, Buddy James, contacted choirs from every continent
and invited them to share their celebratory music with all of us! Plan now to
join us at
[YouTube.com/ScholaCantorum1](https://youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1) for this
exciting experience! This international choral collaboration will be performed
ONLINE for all to enjoy, **absolutely FREE!**

Schola Around the World  
LIVE on Sunday December 27, 2020  
at 1:00pm PST (9:00pm UT)  
ONLINE at [YouTube.com/ScholaCantorum1](https://youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1)

Recorded entirely offsite by singers from _Mexico,_ _Brazil,_ _Australia,_
_Lithuania,_ _South Korea,_ and _the Congo,_ as well as by the Schola Cantorum
singers, this performance uses modern recording technology to pull all of the
voices together, resulting in a rich, authentic choral sound.

Every musician poured their hearts into learning new music and even the
pronunciation of new languages. You’ll see and hear over 150 performers
singing in their native tongue, along with the Schola singers. See the joy and
excitement each singer feels to participate in sharing this music with you!

**You pay nothing** — simply visit
[YouTube.com/ScholaCantorum1](https://youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1) for

If you can’t make it to the concert when it’s live, it will still be available for
you to watch at any time following the concert.

Plan now to join people from all over the world as they listen to and watch
this unique choral celebration!

**_A most joyful holiday season to you from all of us at Schola Cantorum!_**
