**LIVE on [YouTube.com/ScholaCantorum1](https://youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1) on  
Sunday, December 27 at 1:00pm PST (9:00pm UT)**

People around the world celebrate this joyous time of year with their own
holiday music. Schola Cantorum’s Artistic Director, Buddy James, contacted
choirs from every continent and invited them to share their rich and celebratory
musical traditions with all of us!

Partnering with over 200 singers from every continent to create this special
holiday concert, Schola Cantorum will be joined by our choral friends from
around the world:

아산시립합창단 Asan Civic Choir (South Korea)  
Blackstone-Ipswich Cambrian Choirs (Australia)  
Coral Cantares Dois Irmãos (Brazil)  
Coro Normalista de Puebla y su Orquesta Sinfónica (Mexico)  
Pro Musica (Lithuania)  
Schola Cantorum Akto (Democratic Republic of Congo)

Recorded in _Australia_, _Brazil_, the _Democratic Republic of Congo_,
_Lithuania_, _Mexico_, _South Korea_, and by Schola Cantorum in the _United
States_, this performance uses modern recording technology to pull all of the
voices together, resulting in a rich, authentic choral sound.

Plan now to join people from all over the world as they view this unique choral
celebration at the PREMIERE on
[YouTube.com/ScholaCantorum1](https://youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1) on
Sunday, December 27 at 1:00pm PST (9:00pm UT)!

The concert will remain available for viewing on our YouTube channel following our Premiere presentation.

**_A most joyful holiday season to you from all of us at Schola Cantorum!_**
