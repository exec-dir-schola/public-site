Each Schola Cantorum Gala is an event to be remembered and
savored. But some are *even more&nbsp;special*.

At **FIESTA: An Evening in Old California**, we surround you with the
colors and sounds of the New World’s Spanish heritage and culture.
*But this is only the&nbsp;beginning!*

At **Fiesta**, we’ll pay special tribute to the incomparable **Maestro
Gregory Wait**, and celebrate his 30th and final year directing Schola
Cantorum. We’ll share messages, gifts and, most of all, music for
the one who’s led us with artistry, integrity and a boundless love
for *the Joy of Singing*.

We’ll also be officially welcoming our new Artistic Director,
**Dr.&nbsp;Buddy James**, who will lead Schola Cantorum for many more exciting
and joyful years of music.

In addition, be ready for some delightful surprises (we’re
keeping them under our hat until the Fiesta) that will truly make the
evening truly unforgettable.

An essential segment of this event, of course, is our
***Fund&#x2011;A&#x2011;Need***.  This provides the much-needed financial
foundation for Dr. James’s first year, as well as to continue our tradition of
fine choral performances.

[Register now](#register) to be at this once-in-a-lifetime event. You will play
an important part in Schola Cantorum’s ongoing mission to bring *the Joy of
Singing* to all in the Silicon Valley — from children to parents and
grandparents, as a valued Schola supporter!
