From _The Sound of Music_ to _South Pacific_ and _Oklahoma!_
Richard Rodgers left us an astonishing — and great fun to sing —
catalogue of Broadway show hits.
Dawn Reyen has culled some of everyone’s favorites to make this an afternoon
that will lift your spirits as you lift your voice in glorious song!

No musical experience needed — simply come, follow the words projected on the
screen, and sing!
