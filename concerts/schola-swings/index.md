**A swingin’ presentation of Duke Ellington’s famous Sacred Concerts,
performed with soloists, a tap dancer and a Big Band!**

In his fifty+ years of composition and performance, Duke Ellington composed
three concerts of Sacred Music; the first was composed for, and premiered
at, the opening of San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral in 1965. It was instantly
regarded as a watershed moment joining sacred music and jazz. Be prepared
for a rich musical experience mixing faith and Ellington’s incomparable jazz.

> “[Ellington’s Concert of Sacred Music] taps into Ellington’s roots in showbiz
> and African-American culture as well as his evidently deep religious faith,
> throwing it all together in the spirit of universality and sealing everything
> with the stamps of his musical signatures.”  
>— Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell
