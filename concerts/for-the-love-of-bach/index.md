**Bach in Leipzig (Cantatas BWV 29, 50, 147)**  
_Featuring Sinfonia Schola Cantorum and soloists_

As a composer for the Lutheran church, Johann Sebastian Bach regularly wrote
cantatas for the liturgical year.  Schola Cantorum presents three favorites for
a festive orchestra, including trumpets and drums, soloists and chorus that
features the familiar _“Jesu, Joy of Man‘s Desiring”_.
