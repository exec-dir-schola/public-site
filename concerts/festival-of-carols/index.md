We raise our voices *together* once again this holiday season in a program of beloved carols and holiday tunes. 
Ralph Vaughan Williams&rsquo;s *Fantasia on Christmas Carols* is the highlight of this concert that also features music 
by Morten Lauridsen, Benjamin Britten, and Andr&eacute; Thomas, and classics such as the *Carol of the Drum* and the *Carol of the Bells*.

This concert will take place *live* on **Sunday, December 12, at 2:00 pm Pacific time** at **St. Joseph of Cupertino Catholic Church**,
10110 N. DeAnza Blvd (near Stevens Creek), Cupertino. We'd love to see you there!

*For the safety of our audience and our members, attendees will be required to show proof of vaccination and wear masks while in the building.*
