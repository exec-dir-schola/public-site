After 608 days (but who&rsquo;s counting?) of not being able to perform live music for a live audience, Schola Cantorum presented
**_It&rsquo;s a Grand Time for Singing_** on **Saturday, October 30** at the **First Congregational Church of
Palo Alto**. It was a tremendous, uplifting experience for singers and audience alike, and we are _so_ happy to be singing again! Special
thanks go out to **John Murden** for sponsoring this concert.

**_If you missed the concert_**, you can still listen on your computer anytime from **Sunday, November 7** to **Sunday, November 26**. Gather your friends and family and listen to the concert for a single fee of $25. <a href="https://www.feelitlive.com/place/music/schola-cantorum-a-grand-time-for-singing/concerts" target="_blank">Click here</a> to sign up for this on-line event!
