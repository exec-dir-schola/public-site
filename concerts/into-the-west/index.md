Music from and inspired by the Great American West Coast.  We’ll perform Eric Whitacre’s charming
_Goodnight Moon_, and _Come to the Woods_ by Jake Runestad, based on the writings of John Muir.
Also featured is the world premiere of a work by Eric Tuan, using text by this year’s winner of
Schola Cantorum’s Poetry Contest.
