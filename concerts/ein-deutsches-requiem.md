**A Human Requiem**

Brahms’s Requiem focuses on the living &mdash; “A German Requiem,” has for many
music enthusiasts become an anthem for our time, with grand social and political
reverberations. Yet, for Brahms, this work was deeply personal, with the
composer himself selecting appropriate texts from the German-language Bible;
emphasizing transition from suffering and mourning to comfort. Come celebrate
and commemorate the culmination of Gregory Wait’s thirty-year tenure with Schola
Cantorum.
