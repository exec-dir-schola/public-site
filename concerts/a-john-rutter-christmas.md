Composer, arranger, editor and conductor, John Rutter first became known for his
carols for Christmas. Join Schola Cantorum for a cozy, melodious afternoon of
works for the holiday season. Of course, no Schola holiday concert would be
complete without our annual holiday carol sing-along, so bring your voice with
you!
