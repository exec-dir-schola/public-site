<p style="color:red;font-style:italic">New location for this concert!</p>

Joyous and mystical holiday music for chorus and harp, featuring a performance
of Kirke Mechem’s Seven Joys of Christmas. Mechem’s delightful and moving
composition includes carols from different countries, which he uses to highlight
different aspects of joy for the Christmastide.  Be sure to bring your singing
voice, too, as we continue our beloved tradition of singing, together, music of
the season. And be on the lookout for our annual visitor, St. Nick!  This
concert often sells out, so be sure to order tickets in advance so you won’t
miss the fun.
