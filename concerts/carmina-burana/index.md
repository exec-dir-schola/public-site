**Fortune, Empress of the World**  

Composed by Carl Orff in the 1930s, Carmina Burana is a scenic cantata beloved
by choirs and audiences alike.  The work is based on 13th century manuscripts,
written in Latin and German, which were discovered during the renovation of a
Bavarian monastery.  Along with the singers of Schola Cantorum, we showcase
vocal soloists, _Crystal Childrenâ€™s Choir_, two pianos and six percussionists.
