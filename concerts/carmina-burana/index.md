**Fortune, Empress of the World**  
_PLUS new works by Eric Tuan, using poetry by talented local students_

Composed by Carl Orff in the 1930s, Carmina Burana is a scenic cantata beloved
by choirs and audiences alike.  Along with Schola Cantorum’s performance, we
showcase vocal soloists, _Crystal Children’s Choir_, two pianos and six
percussionists.  This concert will also introduce new works by local composer
Eric Tuan, inspired by and using the work of the winners of our poetry contest.
