Last performed by the chorale over 30 years ago, this beloved masterpiece will
thrill you with its beauty and drama.

Felix Mendelssohn composed the oratorio, ***Elijah***, in the spirit of his
Baroque predecessors, Bach and Handel, whose music he loved. While ***Elijah***
was modeled after the oratorios of these two Baroque masters, its lyricism and
use of orchestral and choral color clearly reflects Mendelssohn’s own genius as
an early Romantic composer.
