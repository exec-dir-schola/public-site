# Educational Outreach

{{% imgfloatleft "outreach.png" "Example school assembly" %}}
In our regular seasons,
Schola Cantorum offers a free enrichment assembly program for 5th graders,
entitled “What is a Chorus?”  The 40-60 minute program uses 16 Schola adult
choristers to demonstrate the four vocal voices — soprano, alto, tenor, and
bass — singing separately and together in harmony. 

We also perform seasonal programs at senior living communities, as well as
caroling in local downtown areas.

We plan to resume these activities when circumstances permit. {{sandbox}}In the meantime,
we are working on a program of "virtual caroling" for the Los Altos History
Museum's November celebration of History Day.{{/sandbox}}
