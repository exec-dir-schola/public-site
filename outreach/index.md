Schola Cantorum offers a free enrichment assembly program for 5th graders,
entitled “What is a Chorus?”  The 40-60 minute program uses 16 Schola adult
choristers to demonstrate the four vocal voices — soprano, alto, tenor, and
baritone — singing separately and together in harmony.

We use a variety of singing styles from classical music songs to spirituals,
chosen for their appeal to the fifth grade age group. Several of the selections
have a tie-in with 5th grade US History curriculum.  An essential part of the
program is that it is participatory for the students, who will have the
opportunity to experience first hand the joy of choral singing through familiar
rounds like “When the Saints Go Marching In” and “Swing Low Sweet Chariot.”  Our
program may be customized by the school to best fit its needs.  For further
information or to schedule a Schola Cantorum school assembly, please contact the
office at (650) 254‑1700 or info@scholacantorum.org.
