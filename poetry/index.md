# 2019–2020 Poetry Contest

Schola Cantorum offers an opportunity for young local poets to hear their words
put to music by the renowned composer Eric Tuan and sung by a choir of
seventy-five voices under the direction of Schola’s artistic director, Buddy
James. The contest is a contemporary venture of artistic collaboration and
community, open to students who are residents of Mountain View, Los Altos, Los
Altos Hills, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, and Cupertino, attending grades 9 through 12
in the fall of 2019.

* 2019–2020 Theme: “California’s Natural Beauty”
* Prizes are: $500 First Place; $300 Second Place; $200 Third Place. While only
  the First Place poem will be set to music and performed at a live concert, all
  prize winners will be featured in Schola Cantorum’s publicity materials and on
  the group’s website.
* The contest will be judged by a panel consisting of a local Poet Laureate, a
  local journalist, Schola Cantorum Directors and composer Eric Tuan. The
  submission deadline is September 27, 2019. The 10 finalists will be announced
  on February 15, 2020. The three winning poems will be announced at Schola’s
  early spring concerts which are scheduled for Saturday, February 29 and
  Sunday, March 1. The title of this Schola concert is “Into the West”. The
  music selected for performance at this concert will be choral music from and
  inspired by the Great American West Coast, featuring the works of composers
  Morten Lauridson, Eric Whitacre and others.

We recommend all entrants read the rules carefully before entering. Entry in the
competition will be deemed to be acceptance of these conditions.

## Entry Conditions and Guidelines

1. The contest is free and open to all Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto,
   Cupertino, Los Altos and Los Altos Hills residents attending 9th, 10th, 11th
   and 12th grades in the fall of 2019.
2. There is a maximum of 2 poems per entrant. All poems must be in English, be
   the original work of the author and not have been previously published or won
   another competition at the time of entry. For the purpose of this contest,
   the following definition of “published” will apply: intentionally distributed
   to the public in any format “accepted for publication or broadcast in any
   format including self-publishing for monetary gain”. Poems may have been part
   of a school assignment and reviewed by a High School teacher.
3. No entrant may win more than one prize.
4. All poems must have a title and be 20 lines or less (title and spaces between
   stanzas do not count). Any rhyme scheme except free verse is allowed.  The
   evaluation of the poems will be partially based upon their ability to be
   adapted into a choral composition.
5. All entries must be submitted online, through the form that will be available
   on this page beginning June 1, 2019. No late entries will be accepted.
   Entries received after the deadline will be disqualified. No postal entries
   are accepted — sorry. We do hope you can find someone to help you with an
   online entry — or try your school or local library.
6. Each entry must be the entrant’s/author’s original work. Should an entry be
   found to contain any plagiarized content it will be automatically
   disqualified from the competition, along with any additional work by that
   poet.
7. Schola Cantorum reserves the right to publish, perform or broadcast, without
   fee to the author, in part or in whole, award winning or commended entries
   and photographs on the website, in an anthology and/or in media publications
   or broadcasts. Copyright remains with the author thereafter. No payment or
   reward will be made to the entrant for any such performance or publication.
8. Schola Cantorum also reserves the right to give entrants’ contact details to
   the media, if among the winners.

## Judging and Notifications

1. The 10 finalists for the contest will be judged anonymously by Schola’s
   Directors, a local journalist, and a local Poet Laureate.
2. Finalists will be notified via email by February 15, 2020. The judges’
   decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into.
3. The top three winners will be announced at Schola’s early spring concert. The
   first prize winning poem (or an excerpt of the poem) will be used in a choral
   performance at that concert. Prizes will be presented at this event. Prizes
   will be mailed if winner cannot attend in person.
4. Submissions that do not fulfill the requirements will not be judged.
