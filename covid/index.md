# COVID-19 Update

**Schola Continues!**
Yes, we have taken steps to ensure that Schola will be here when the COVID-19
restrictions are lifted, and it's once again safe for us to sing together and
to sing for you in person. Meanwhile, we will be presenting virtual offerings
on our own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/scholacantorum1/videos).
You can also keep up with Schola on our [FaceBook page](https://www.facebook.com/scholacantorum.org).

Meanwhile, stay safe and healthy!<br>
Dan Morris, Executive Director
