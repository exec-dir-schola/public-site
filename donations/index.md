### Help us spread the Joy of Singing for all in the Silicon Valley by donating to Schola Cantorum

Schola Cantorum is dedicated to providing great music to you and your community
through concerts, kids’ educational programs, free visits to senior centers, and
fun singing afternoons for all.  We also commission new works by local
composers.  This keeps choral music alive and growing.

As a nonprofit, we’re dependent upon the generosity of our donors.  And your
donations are tax deductible.  So why wait?  There are many ways that you can
donate!
